We present the first dataset of non-central panoramas for scene understanding. Our dataset is composed by 2574 images of different Atlanta and Manhattan virtual environments.
We also provide Depth maps for each image as well as the labelling of the structural lines to obtain the layout of the environments. Additionally, we provide different tools to
encode and decode the depth maps, different annotations of the dataset in raw MatLab files and Python-friendly files (as well as a little program to transform from the MatLab files to Python Files) 

You can download the full dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18OQXpbZsr3RBphU0kJC0OS2OXr-3BrkV?usp=sharing)

In the dictionary 'ScaledLayoutsSplit.pkl', we provide the splits used in the works [Scaled 360 layouts: revisiting non-central panoramas](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/OmniCV/papers/Berenguel-Baeta_Scaled_360_Layouts_Revisiting_Non-Central_Panoramas_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf) and [Atlanta Scaled layouts from Non-central Panoramas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/pattern-recognition)
